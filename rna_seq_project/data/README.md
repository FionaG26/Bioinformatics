## Glossary: RNA-Seq & Differential Expression

### FASTQ
A text-based format for storing both nucleotide sequences and their corresponding quality scores from high-throughput sequencing.

### Phred Score
A measure of the quality of identification of nucleobases generated by automated DNA sequencing. A higher score indicates higher confidence:
- Q10: 1 in 10 error rate
- Q30: 1 in 1000
- Q40: 1 in 10000

### Illumina Encoding (Phred+33)
A method where ASCII characters represent Phred quality scores by adding 33 to the score.

### Read
A single DNA fragment sequenced from a sample. Reads can be single-end (one direction) or paired-end (both directions).

### Replicate
A biological or technical repeat of an experiment to ensure statistical confidence.

### Quality Score
A score assigned to each base in a sequence read, reflecting the probability that the base call is incorrect.

### Adapter
Short sequences used during library preparation that can contaminate reads and need to be trimmed.

### Trimming
The process of removing low-quality bases and adapters from reads before alignment.

### Alignment (Mapping)
The process of matching sequence reads to a reference genome to identify where each read originates from.

### Reference Genome
A digital nucleic acid sequence database that represents a species' DNA used for alignment.

### HISAT2
A fast and sensitive alignment program for mapping sequencing reads to a reference genome.

### FeatureCounts
A program that assigns mapped reads to genomic features such as genes or exons for quantification.

### Count Matrix
A table where rows are genes, columns are samples, and values are read counts (raw or normalized).

### DESeq2
An R package used for analyzing count data from RNA-Seq experiments to find differentially expressed genes.

### Differential Expression (DE)
Identifying genes that show statistically significant changes in expression between experimental conditions.

### Volcano Plot
A type of scatterplot that shows the magnitude of change (log2 fold change) versus statistical significance (-log10 p-value).

### PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
A dimensionality reduction technique used to visualize variability in RNA-Seq data across samples.

### Heatmap
A graphical representation of data where individual values are represented by colors â€” useful in gene expression.

### Pathway Enrichment
A method for identifying biological pathways that are overrepresented in a set of differentially expressed genes.

### clusterProfiler
An R package for statistical analysis and visualization of functional profiles for genes and gene clusters.

### GTF/GFF File
Annotation files that provide genomic feature coordinates (e.g., gene start/end) for a reference genome.

### STAR / HISAT2 Index
A set of files prepared from a reference genome to allow fast alignment.

### TPM / FPKM / RPKM
Normalization methods for expression data:
- TPM: Transcripts Per Million
- FPKM: Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads
- RPKM: Reads Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads

### MultiQC
A tool that aggregates results from bioinformatics analyses like FastQC into a single report.

### FastQC
A quality control tool that provides an overview of base quality, GC content, duplication levels, and other QC metrics.

### Cutadapt / Trimmomatic
Tools for removing adapter sequences and trimming low-quality ends from sequencing reads.
